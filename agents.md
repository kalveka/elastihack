# üß† Azion Context Agents

## Overview
This document defines the agents that power the **Azion Context API**, which retrieves critical compliance context and external research to inform model selection and evaluation within the Azion platform.

Each agent operates as a serverless function or microservice, and together they enable dynamic reasoning pipelines that enrich user prompts before invoking reasoning models such as **Claude 3 Sonnet** or **Mixtral 8x7B**.

## Agent Roles

### 1. Context Fetcher (Elastic)
**Purpose:** Retrieve critical internal compliance, risk, and security context from the Elastic Stack.

- **Inputs:**  
  - `prompt` (string) ‚Äî user business question or system request  
- **Outputs:**  
  - `elastic_context` (array of documents)  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Queries the `internal-docs` Elastic index for compliance context  
  - Filters and returns up to N relevant documents ranked by relevance score  
- **Policies:**  
  - Must sanitize and redact sensitive fields prior to downstream use  
  - Only query indices whitelisted under `EULA::ApprovedIndexes`

---

### 2. Research Fetcher
**Purpose:** Retrieve relevant external research or whitepapers from trusted APIs (e.g., Semantic Scholar, arXiv).

- **Inputs:**  
  - `prompt` (string)  
- **Outputs:**  
  - `research_context` (array of papers)  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Performs semantic search using the business prompt  
  - Returns concise metadata (title, abstract, URL, authors)  
- **Policies:**  
  - Limit results to 3‚Äì5 papers per query  
  - Must use public or licensed sources only  

---

### 3. Context Aggregator
**Purpose:** Merge multiple context streams into a unified payload for reasoning models.

- **Inputs:**  
  - `elastic_context`  
  - `research_context`  
  - `model_attribute_context`  
- **Outputs:**  
  - `context` object with combined data  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Performs lightweight deduplication and normalization  
  - Annotates context source for traceability  
  - Includes model attribute catalog entries when available  

---

### 4. Model Selector (Claude 3 Sonnet)
**Purpose:** Identify the best-fit models and craft benchmarking prompts for downstream evaluation.

- **Inputs:**  
  - `prompt` (business request)  
  - `context` (aggregated data)  
  - `model_attribute_context` (catalog metadata from Elastic)  
- **Outputs:**  
  - JSON with fields:  
    - `candidate_models` (array of exactly three objects with `model_id`, `model_name`, `sample_prompt`, `reasoning`, `policy_notes`)  
    - `recommended_model` (object with final pick and justification)  
    - `governance_notes` (array of compliance considerations)  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Uses catalog metadata from `model-attributes` to pick the three most relevant models  
  - Generates tailored sample prompts that stress-test compliance and quality dimensions for each model  
  - Explains the governance trade-offs behind the primary recommendation  

---

### 5. Judge (Mixtral 8x7B)
**Purpose:** Evaluate candidate model outputs for factual accuracy, compliance adherence, and tone quality before confirmation.

- **Inputs:**  
  - `prompt` (original business request)  
  - `selection` (model selector output)  
  - `candidate_models` (three sample prompts with reasoning)  
  - `candidate_outputs` (responses generated by running each sample prompt)  
  - `context` (reference data)  
- **Outputs:**  
  - `evaluation` (JSON containing verdict, risks, suggestions, top two models, and final recommendation)  
- **Behavior:**  
  - Applies rubric-based assessment using structured output schema  
  - Selects the two strongest candidates, recommends the best, and emits transparent reasoning and confidence score

## Governance Notes

- All agents must comply with Azion‚Äôs internal AI EULA and Data Classification Policy.
- No agent may send customer or personal data to non-approved endpoints.
- Logs are anonymized and retained per internal retention policy.
- All external API usage must align with corporate license terms and export restrictions.
- Future Extensions
- Add ‚ÄúKnowledge Synthesizer‚Äù agent to build longer-term summaries from prior prompts.
- Extend compliance fetcher to support Confluence and Jira sources.
- Add retrieval caching layer for performance optimization.
